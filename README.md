# Battleship Software Project

A software project is part of my lecture in Software Engineering at the Reutlingen University. Students are encouraged to develop a software using established software engineering practises including goal formulation, team constitution, requirements analysis, usage of UML, design patterns, software testing and versioning. 

In the winter term 2015/16 the project is to develop is a [battleship clone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_%28game%29). The basic game rules provide a minimum set of requirements, which can be freely modified or extended by the students.

## Objective

Within the current term I want to increase my knowledge on some modern software technologies.

I have compiled the following technology mix below. I want to learn how quickly one can design, develop, test and document an application using this mix. Furthermore, I am interested in trying out microservices as an architectural style for my software. 

My research questions are
* How smoothly play these technologies together?
* How steep is the learning curve? 

Technology mix

* [Storiesonboard](http://storiesonboard.com/) to form a common understanding and give the requirment analysis process a direction 
* [StarUML2](http://staruml.io) as UML tool for communicating software designs and documentating them
* [UMPLE](http://www.umple.org) for rapid model-driven programming 
* Java is the primary programming language
* [Randoop](https://github.com/randoop) or [EvoSuite](http://www.evosuite.org/) for unit testing
* [Jolie](http://www.jolie-lang.org/) to support the implementation of a microservices based application
* [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) to easily monitor the application
* GitHub for software versioning

[Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) will be the primary IDE, because for most of the aforementioned technologies there is an Eclipse pluging available.

## Development Journal
The wiki pages contain my [development journal](https://github.com/cdeck3r/BattleShip/wiki) to documenting my efforts in following the objective and evaluating the results.
